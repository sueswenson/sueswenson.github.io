			<h1>Need a Mental Break?</h1>
			<h2>It's a walk in the park!</h2>
			<p>Do you have brain fatique or stimulation overload? If so, it is more important than ever to take a break, and this can be accomplished quite simply--by walking in nature. Walking in nature not only clears your mind but can improve your mood and overall concentration. Finding a peaceful garden even in New York City is much easier than most people imagine. So take a break and explore in one (or all) of these peaceful gardens...and let your mind reset, allowing you to do something creative, perhaps even spectacular!</p>

			<h1>Central Park's Conservatory Garden</h1>
			<h3>Step through an iron Vanderbilt Gate into the beauty of the Park's only formal garden.</h3>
			<p>A secluded 6-acre oasis, just a few steps away from one of the City’s busiest streets; the garden offers a fragrant respite from the clatter of the urban life.  </p> <p> Enjoy a walk on a lawn that is lined with crabapple trees and ends with purple wisteria over-looking a geyser fountain. Wander South to an English-styled garden with blooms to enjoy year-round. Head North to the French-styled garden with large floral designs, which change seasonally. It's definately a classy retreat from the street.</p>

			<h1>Hallett Nature Sanctuary</h1>
			<h3>For a rustic nature walk, try this 4-acre area which was restored and opened to the public last year for the first time since 1934. </h3>
			<p>Just the thought of an 83-year-old area of the park reopening should peak anyone's interest, and the rustic wooden gate will lead you into this quiet sanctuary. The paths lead you up to the top of a hill overlooking the pond full of other creatures escaping the concrete streets.</p>
			<p>Walking along the nature paths you can forget you're in Central Park- let alone the City. But look up and poking through the trees you'll see the familiar buildings and rooftops. Listening to the busy birds and other wildlife making a home here, is wonderful way to become part of the nature-moment. </p>

			<h1>Shakespeare Garden</h1>
			<h3>Another less-visited section of the Park, this garden is perfect for a quiet stroll along its winding paths.</h3>
			<p>Located behind the Shakespeare Delacort theater, many people overlook this garden and go straight up to the Belvedere Castle instead. They are missing a chance to see the 4-acres of plants that are mentioned in his plays and change during the seasons. </p>
			<p>It is a designated Quiet Zone, and even if you don't stop and smell the roses, you can't help but pause to read some of the Shakespeare quotes in little plaques that line the paths, such as Hamlet's: There's rosemary, that's for rememberance. Pray you, love, remember. And there is pansies, that's for thoughts. </p>
